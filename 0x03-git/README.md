Hey man, I am trying a new method to add a text to my README file with vi. I used to use echo on shell earlier. i.e echo 'text' >README.md. Man, vi is actually cool. You can try it out too.
Hey Man, it would interest you to know you can add changes to your files from GITHUB too. I am adding this right from Github not terminal. so cool.
